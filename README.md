# Vending Machine

This design system is designed to complete the final project of the Digital System Design (Course & Experiment). We will present to you how to implement a VHDL that describes the functionality of a vending machine (RAM included). Suppose we have a vending machine that sells drink and food that all costs are same (10). Moreover we have only 4 types of coins: 00, 01, 10, 11. Our objective is to design a state machine that determines when to dispense a food or drink, how to return the change, or request more money if it's lacking. In this design we also concern about stock of food and drink. Thats way we use memory block (RAM) to memorize and calculate remaining items.
